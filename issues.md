# Project ideas:

- rewrite flask APIs in Haskell
- DOI.hs + pandoc example, tutorials?

# Reddit:
- is Haskell elitist? (not, but Go is garbage)
- Abstract types make haskell hard
- you are ready to program in Haskell (list of libs)
- too many operators

# Excercises:
- parsers eg kep.hs
- dice (next roll) + SO answer
- replicate GNU utlities
