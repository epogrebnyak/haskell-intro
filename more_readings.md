# Discoveries: 

## Python similarities:

>   Yuras: I think it is better to start with Haskell directly, and then try to apply things to python using these libraries.

However, analogies still help a bit:

- map/filer, list comprehensions  
- [partial](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.partial) helps understand _currying_
- lambdas, nameless functions
- kwargs unpacking is a remote analogy to _pattern matching_ 

For functional programming in python see: 

- [Intro to functional programming in python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)
- <https://github.com/billpmurphy/hask> and [similar](https://github.com/sfermigier/awesome-functional-python#libraries) - some Haskell in python, EP: is this a good direction to learn?

## C similarities

- algebraic data types are similar to struct and unions 

## General concepts

- recursion (but there is also tail recursion with lazy typing!)

# Some readings

## Higher-level overview

- [Haskell Concepts in One Sentence](https://ndrgrnd.net/posts/haskellOneSentence.html) - roghly corresponds 
  to any course table of contents, but made as a sentence, nice!

## Tutorials   

- <http://learnyouahaskell.com/> - seems a nice intro, but not even in difficulty, eg

## Reputable Stack overflow questions

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368926/division-in-haskell (what is `x:xs`?)


# Extra stuff 

## Category theory

Category theory is hard topic, but perhaps worth knowing about.

-  Zarak: for category theory I have [this playlist saved](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_), 
   have only watched the first lecture though
