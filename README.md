# haskell-intro

Curated introduction to Haskell by [Yuras Shumovich](https://twitter.com/shumovichy)
as studied by [Evgeniy](https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE) and [Zarak](https://github.com/zarak).

We were lucky to have Yuras as a tutor in Haskell for this small course
at the end of 2018. Yuras knows 150% of Haskell, but he adjusted instruction occording to our prior knowledge (or, rather, ignorance), beliefs and aspirations. Initially 
we wanted to learn just some functional concepts, but Haskell proved very immersive
and engaging, so we are on track to learn more. 

### Preliminary 

Set up GHCi Haskell on your computer or use a limited web version as
suggested [here](setup.md).

### Core files

1. Yuras original [topic list](topics.md), a great plan to learn. If you are to take 
   just one thing out with you from this repo, take this topic list - it will guide you 
   throughout your learning whatever resources you choose to study with.  

2. This repository holds session transcripts (as played in interpreter and saved scripts) by class 1-7 closely following the topics above. Hoping to do some work on organisisng the classes for future reference. 

3. Extra links for [quick and longer readings](biblio.md). As we went though the course   
   we looked for good references to follow up on topics studies. Here is our little collection. 

### Follow-up

- `Prelude` module holds basic functions and worth studying on its own. You can can get type declarations of Prelude by typing `:browse Prelude` in intepreter or check this command output [here](browse_prelude.hs). Examples of `Prelude` usage are included in [A Tour of the Haskell Prelude][pre].

- Bartosz Milewski's '[Category Theory for Programmers][ctp]' is a great intro to 
  Haskell itself, written in  very good technical language and rolled at a very readable pace. It is a top trending repository on Github. Suggested reading up to a point of your saturation.

### Personal notes (work in progress)
- [notes.hs](notes.hs)
- [Similarities to other languages](sim.md)
- [how_we_started.md](how_we_started.md)

Will be [glad to hear](https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE/status/1082306102468005891) if this repo is useful for your learning!
