# haskell-intro

Curated introduction to Haskell by [Yuras Shumovich](https://twitter.com/shumovichy)
as studied by [Evgeniy](https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE) and Zarak.

We were lucky to have Yuras as a tutoe in Haskell for this small course
at the end of 2018. Yuras knows 150% of Haskell, but he adjusted instruction occrding to our prior knowledge (or, rather, ignorance), beliefs and aspirations. Initially 
we wanted to learn just some functional concepts, but Haskell provided very immersive
and engaging.

### Core files

- Yuras original [topic list](topics.md), a great plan to learn
- The github repository holds session transcripts (as played in interpreter and saved scripts) by class 1-7 closely following the topics above
- [Setting up Haskell](setup.md) on your computer
- Extra links for [quick and longer readings](biblio.md)

### Additions

- [`:browse Prelude`](browse_prelude.hs)
- [Similarities to other languages](sim.md)

### Personal notes
- [notes.hs](notes.hs)
- [how_we_started.md](how_we_started.md)

Will be [glad to hear](https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE) if it is useful for your learning!
