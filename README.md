# haskell-intro
Short overview of Haskell concepts


#### Tutor:

*Y*: @yuras

#### Student background:

Write something abnout what you do and your interests, perhaps add few links - it helps our tutor to prepare: 

- **EP**: economist by education, interested in unit testing and reproducible 
  economic research, eg  [data science projects as a data pipeline](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).
  Maintainer of [mini-kep macroeconomic time series dataset](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro), 
  course author on [machine readable financial statements analysis](https://github.com/ru-corporate/teaching-2018). 
  No formal computer science background, but fair math and econometrics. 
  [1k+ reputation on Stack Overflow for python](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758363/epo)  
  
- **Zarak**: studied neuroscience at college, along with coursework in applied math and physics. hoping to study a bit of category theory via [Chapter 0](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Chapter-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/0821847813) by Aluffi next summer.

#### Some prior reading:

- [Intro to functional programming in python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) - we do understand most written here, but not using `itertools` as much

- [Haskell Concepts in One Sentence](https://ndrgrnd.net/posts/haskellOneSentence.html) - maybe group these concepts by level of difficulty, and work through some examples? We do not have to cover all, but it seems in interesting list of jargon and topics. 

- <http://learnyouahaskell.com/> - seems a nice intro as long at deals with familiar topics (eg map/filer, list comprehensions)

- <https://github.com/billpmurphy/hask> and [similar](https://github.com/sfermigier/awesome-functional-python#libraries) - some Haskell in python, Y: is this a good direction to learn?

- Y: anything you can recommend for us to review?

- connections to category theory (Z: can you add a video link? will not be not in scope for this course, but lets keep the link anyways). For category theory I have [this playlist saved](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_), have only watched the first lecture though - Zarak.


#### Learning objective:

> Introduction to new approaches in programming using Haskell and 

Comment: we are likely to continue use python/julia/R for development, but introduction to  
Haskell can be thought provoking for us - the result is a little change we think of developing code.

#### Questions:

- we know some functional tools in python, eg lambdas, list comprehension, iterators, `filter`, `map` (can apply), 
  `itertools` (mostly heard of). how far haskell extends these? (probably a silly question)

- Haskell type system motivation (what is being achived) and implementation

- what are the excercises to understand monad?

- `pandoc` seems the most famous popular application written in Haskell. Any story behind it?
   Was Haskell particularly well suited for file format transformations or chosen accidentally for it?

- very short overview of Haskell in production - what is Haskell community doing? 

- haslkell seems strognly typed, does this make it a fast?

- please extend / modify


#### Next steps:

- [ ] merge updates to this document + videochat to discuss it
- [ ] make a simple outline for several lectures
- [ ] students should install haskell(?)
- [ ] choose format to communicate (Hangouts for video + some texting app + dump some code/notes here?)
