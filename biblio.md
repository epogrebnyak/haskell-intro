# Readings

Readings about haskell are quite numerous. Good lists are [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell).


## Quick introductions

- [Haskell Concepts in One Sentence](https://ndrgrnd.net/posts/haskellOneSentence.html) 
  luckily corresponds to our topics list!

- Simon Peyton-Jones, one of language creators. _Escape from the ivory tower: the Haskell journey [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re96UgMk6GQ&feature=youtu.be&t=725)_. Has cool graphs about adoption curves of the languages.

- Skim a [cheatsheet](http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/CheatSheet.pdf) for terminology.

- [Is Rust functional](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional) - yes,
  the article has simple Haskell counterexamples for Rust.

## Longer reads

- <http://learnyouahaskell.com/> - a nice intro as far as it deals with familiar topics (eg map/filer, list comprehensions).

- Interactive slides with several lectures on Haskell from Nishant Shuklan.
  Favourite slide: [quotes about programming languages](http://shuklan.com/haskell/lec01.html#/0/30)

- <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/haskell> - available as Android app (and look better on android without no ads) 

## Reputable Stack Overflow questions and toy code

- [exponentiation-in-haskell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6400568/exponentiation-in-haskell)
- [division-in-haskell: what is `x:xs`?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368926/division-in-haskell)
- [Fib numbers](https://wiki.haskell.org/The_Fibonacci_sequence#Naive_definition)


## Special topics 

### Category theory 

You can learn and use Haskell without looking at cat theory.  

- Bartosz Milewski's '[Category Theory for Programmers][ctp]' is a great intro to 
  Haskell itself, written in very good language and at very readable pace. Top trending repository on Github.

- Category theory [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) - Zarak


### Typesystem

- [In cartoons](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
- [Don't read the monad tutorials.](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#eightfold-path-to-monad-satori)
