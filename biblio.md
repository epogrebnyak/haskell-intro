# Readings

Readings about haskell are quite numerous. Good lists are [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell).


## Quick introductions

- [Haskell Concepts in One Sentence](https://ndrgrnd.net/posts/haskellOneSentence.html) 
  luckily corresponds to our topics list!

- Simon Peyton-Jones, one of language creators. _Escape from the ivory tower: the Haskell journey [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re96UgMk6GQ&feature=youtu.be&t=725)_. Has cool graphs about adoption curves of the languages.

- Skim a [cheatsheet](http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/CheatSheet.pdf) for terminology.

- [Is Rust functional](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional) - yes,
  the article has simple Haskell counterexamples for Rust.


## Longer reads

- <http://learnyouahaskell.com/> - a nice intro as far as it deals with familiar topics (eg map/filer, list comprehensions).

- Interactive slides with several lectures on Haskell from Nishant Shuklan.
  Favourite slide: [quotes about programming languages](http://shuklan.com/haskell/lec01.html#/0/30)

- <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/haskell> - available as Android app (and look better on android without no ads) 

## Special topics

- Really nice [functions by tutorial by Carl Burch](http://www.toves.org/books/hsfun/),
  the only additiona could have been lambda functions

### Type and type classes
- <http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-typeclasses.html>
- <http://shuklan.com/haskell/lec03.html#/0/10>
- <http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses>

### Typesystem
- [In cartoons](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
- [Don't read the monad tutorials](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#eightfold-path-to-monad-satori)
