# haskell-intro

 Initially we wanted to learn *'just some functional concepts'*, but Haskell proved very immersive and engaging.

#### Student background:

Write something abnout what you do and your interests, perhaps add few links - it helps our tutor to prepare: 

- **EP**: interested in reproducible 
  economic research, eg  [data science projects as a data pipeline](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).
  Maintainer of [mini-kep macroeconomic time series dataset](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro), 
  course author on [machine readable financial statements analysis](https://github.com/ru-corporate/teaching-2018). 
  No formal computer science background, but fair math and econometrics. 
  [some reputation on Stack Overflow for python](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758363/epo)  
  
- **Zarak**: studied neuroscience at college, along with coursework in applied math and physics. Hoping to study a bit of category theory via [Chapter 0](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Chapter-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/0821847813) by Aluffi next summer.

#### Learning objective:

> Introduction to new approaches in programming using Haskell 

Comment: we are likely to continue use python/julia/R for development, but introduction to  
Haskell can be thought provoking for us - the result is a little change we think of developing code.

#### Questions:

- we know some functional tools in python, eg lambdas, list comprehension, iterators, `filter`, `map` (can apply), 
  `itertools` (mostly heard of). how far haskell extends these? (probably a silly question)

- Haskell type system motivation (what is being achived) and implementation

- `pandoc` seems the most famous popular application written in Haskell. Any story behind it?
   Was Haskell particularly well suited for file format transformations or chosen accidentally for it?

- very short overview of Haskell in production - what is Haskell community doing? 

- haslkell seems strognly typed, does this make it a fast?

- How is Haskell related to some other functional programming languages? Why use Haskell over, e.g. SML, Erlang?
