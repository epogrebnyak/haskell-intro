# Similarities 

Similarities soon dry out, but help at start. 

## Python similarities

- map/filter, but `Data.List` much richer
- list comprehensions  
- [partial](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.partial) helps understand currying
- lambdas, nameless functions
- kwargs unpacking is a remote analogy to _pattern matching_ 

### More on looking from Python 

> Yuras: I think it is better to start with Haskell directly, and then try to apply things to python using these libraries.

- [Intro to functional programming in python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) - we do understand most written here, but not using `itertools` as much

- <https://github.com/billpmurphy/hask> and [similar](https://github.com/sfermigier/awesome-functional-python#libraries)


## C similarities

- algebraic data types are similar to struct and unions 

## General concepts

- recursion (but in Haskell there is also tail recursion with lazy typing)

## Julia / Lisp
- multiple dispatch
