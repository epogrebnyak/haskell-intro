# Similarities 

Similarities soon dry out, but help at start. 

## Python similarities

- map/filter, but `Data.List` much richer
- list comprehensions  
- [partial](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.partial) helps understand currying
- lambdas, nameless functions
- kwargs unpacking is a remote analogy to _pattern matching_ 

## C similarities

- algebraic data types are similar to struct and unions 

## General concepts

- recursion (but in Haskell there is also tail recursion with lazy typing)
