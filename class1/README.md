# What we learned

- Prelude prompt and loaded packages
- can search library by type
- make easiest funtion possible f(x) = x + 1
- add signature and types to a function
- make a function of two arguments
- chaining and currying
- discussion: there are just values, functions, expression
- lambda (nameless) functions
- `:{}:` and `do`
- `div 7 2` is the same as ``7 `div` 2``
- excercises in data types and fucntions over them with pattern matching
- `:t` know the type
- `show()` built-in
- `:q` quits like in vim!
- `:l` filename
- `:r` reloads

# Questions

- could not replicate `(*)` trickery should `(*) 3 5` work?
- question: what is `Int -> Int -> Int` vs `Int -> (Int -> Int)` (the same) vs `(Int -> Int) -> Int` (function + arg)

# Next

- list comprehensions, map, fileter, etc
- typeclass
- recursive functions, polymorphic datatypes
