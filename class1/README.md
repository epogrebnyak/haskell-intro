What we learned:

- Prelude prompt and loaded packages
- can search library by type 
- make easiest funtion possible f(x) = x + 1
- add signature and types to a function 
- make a fucntion of two arguments 
- chaining and currying
- question: what is `Int -> Int -> Int` vs `Int -> (Int -> Int)` (the same)  vs `(Int -> Int) -> Int` (function + arg)
- discussion: there are just values, functions, expression 
- lambda functions (nameless function)
- `:{}:` and `do`
- `div 7 2` is the same as ``7 `div` 2``
- could not rerplicate `(*)` trickery should `(*) 3 5` work?
- excercises in data types and fucntions over them with pattern matching
- `:t` know the type
- Show() built-in
- `:q` quits like in vim!
- `:l` filename
- `:r` reloads?
- not now: list comprehensions, map, fileter, etc 
- not now: typeclass
- next: recursive functions, polymorphic datatypes
